Graphic Design Projects Using Canva

I have created a wide range of professional designs using Canva, including:

Freelance Profiles: Designed Fiverr, Upwork, and Legit profile gigs to effectively showcase my services.
Social Media & Branding: Created LinkedIn profile, LinkedIn cover, Facebook page logo, and Facebook page cover to strengthen my online presence.
YouTube Branding: Designed YouTube profile picture (DP), YouTube cover, and YouTube watermark for consistent branding across the platform.
Logo & Visual Identity: Developed a custom copyright logo for YouTube to reinforce brand recognition.
These designs were tailored to enhance the visual appeal and professionalism of my online profiles, ensuring consistency and engagement across multiple platforms.
